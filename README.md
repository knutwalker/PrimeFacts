Prime Factors
=============

This small package allows for generation of prime factors.

It is implemented in Scala and uses only functional programming principles.

The prime factors of a positive integer are the prime numbers that divide
that integer exactly, the process if finding these is called
prime factorization.

`primeFactorsLinear` may be used to provide a linear sequence of all prime factors.

`primeFactors` may be used to provide a sequence of tuples of all prime factors
 with their correspondent exponent.

See the tests or the Main App for an example of use.
